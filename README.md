# Pupil-detection-on-python


Pupil and iris of eyes were detected through image processing using opencv library. The output images after the detection were saved in a seperate output folder. 
Since this code was developed to analyze the diameter of pupil changing with intensity of light hence I saved the radiuses of both eyes in a CSV file. The original database had approximately 2000 images.
